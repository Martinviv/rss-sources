## Goal

The StreamSphere RSS Reader Android application aims to simplify the process of discovering and subscribing to RSS feeds on smartphones. To enhance user experience, the app provides a curated list of suggested sources spanning various topics and regions, making it easier for users to get started or explore new interests.

## Suggest New Relevant Sources

If you have recommendations for new sources or topics, please feel free to share them. Your suggestions can help to improve the app and other apps related to this project.

## Multilingual Support

Currently, our suggested sources for topics are primarily in English. However, you can also include sources in other languages as well.
